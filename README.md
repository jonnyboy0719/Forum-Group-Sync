Forum-Group-Sync
==============

###Installation
Put 'Forum-Group-Sync-master' in your addons folder.

###Config
Configuring this script is quite easy. Just input your database's info at the top. Under that, you will see a table labeled GroupID. The ULX group name will equal the ID of the SMF group you want that ULX group to be synced with.

#####Finding Your Forum Group's Group ID
To do this, on your Forum, Head to UserGroup Management (Member Groups, or just UserGroups, depending on your forum software), and check their IDS. An ID will always be disaplayed as "id=15" or "gid=3", and remember, they are always numbers. Depending on your forum software, if you can't find it, search it up on Google if you are very uncertain.
